The configuration package consists of the following:

1) Object repository file - All objects and their locating address are kept here
Any changes in the locating address will be done here and the same will be reflected 
in the scripts of the framework - OR.properties

This file will be also used to define the environment. For example, if the environment is set to
"UAT", the script should have code to immediately refer the username, password and URL defined in
UAT.properties file. That means the config package will also have the testing based properties for 
e.g UAT.properties or System.properties
